# hammerspoon-input-overlay
Super janky input overlay for [Hammerspoon]([Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org)).

Just creates "key down" and "key up" canvases for keys you define and swaps between them.  Completely unoptimised but does the job.

Currently configured for my Celeste inputs. F18 to toggle the display, F19 to snap it to the bottom right corner of the current window.

Do with it as you will, feel free to fork or PR if you make it better.
